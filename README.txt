Project Name: Minecraft 2D Lite

Project Description: A sandbox game similar to Minecraft / terraria where the player is able to break and destroy blocks. Each block correspond to some type of resource which in turn can be crafted into more superior tools/gear. There will be a combat system with a variety of enemies, all of which have some sort of pathfinding mechanism. The terrain that the player encounters will be completely procedurally generated, and the worlds are all infinite (no limit on how big the player’s world can be). With this sort of freedom, the purpose of the game will be completely up to the player’s own discretion! 

Running the project: run script in draw.py, and proceed to follow the in-game instuctions to play the game!

***Please note that the cmu graphics package is altered (as indiated in draw.py) to separate different left and right mouse button functions***
Please use the cmu graphics package version included in the zip

Cheat codes: press "UP" arrow key to fly, this increases the mobility of player for testing purposes. "s" also works to teleport player downward through blocks
