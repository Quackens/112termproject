Problems:
- Infinite world generation: how do you chunk it without lagging?
    - Possible Solution: only spawn one chunk ahead and behind player at a time.
        Load the respective chunks into the player's interactable world whilst saving it
        into a larger array at a given time
    - Calculate what is needed to be draw on screen at a time, and then pass these row col parameters into the nested loops
    - Claculate what is needed to be LOOPED through for simulations, and then take a similar approach to drawing
    - Chunking is a bit complex, if you want complexity points you can do that ig
- Save mechanism - writing to a save file
